# Clustering methods to identify different groups of patients

Different kinds of clustering methods were performed with this dataset to identify different groups of patients and to interpret the output. The following methods were used: K-means, Partitioning around medoids (pam), Gaussian mixture (Mclust) and Latent class (poLCA). 

This dataset contains information on the quality of life measures of 380 hospital patients. There are 22 quality of life variables (WORK2, HOBBY2, BREATH2, PAIN2, REST2, SLEEP2, APPET2, NAUSEA2, VOMIT2, CONST2, DIARR2, TIRED2, PAINADL2, CONCEN2, TENSE2, WORRY2, IRRIT2, DEPRES2, REMEM2, FAMILY2, SOCIAL2, FINANC2) and three other variables (sex, age, live with).  

The quality of life variables have the following ranking: 1 (do not have this quality at all), 2 (have this quality a little), 3 (have this quality quite a bit), and 4 (have this quality very much). 

In this dataset, the rows of any of the 22 quality of life measures which had missing values were removed. 78 rows were removed.
